For all of the TestStack projects, we're using Git for our version control, and [GitHub](https://github.com) as the central repo.

Why Git and GitHub? Git is the leading distributed version control systems. All DVCS are faster than the centralised systems like SVN or CVS. 

Why GitHub? The community around GitHub, including the fantastic service itself and the way they're embracing and encouraging open source software makes it ideal to work with.
