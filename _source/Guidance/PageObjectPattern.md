title: Page Object Pattern
---

The Page Object Pattern is a well known pattern in UI Automation testing, and is supported by both White and Seleno (though each has it's own implementation which is covered in the docs of each project specifically).

When UI Testing, it is easy to think procedurally. If you write all your tests as a series of interactions with elements on a page, or in a window, your tests will be brittle and hard to maintain.

Page objects give logical representations of your the pages/screens in your applications as well as reusable components in those pages/screens to allow you to reuse interaction logic and when the UI changes, you only have to fix your tests in a single place.
