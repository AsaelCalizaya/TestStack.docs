title: TestStack Guidance
---

One of the goals of TestStack is not only to be a collection of some amazing test libraries, but also to provide guidance on how each fit into the testing ecosystem.

The guidance section of TestStacks documentation will cover general testing patterns, and some theory which applies to more than a single project inside TestStack.
