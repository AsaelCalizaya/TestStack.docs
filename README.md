TestStack.docs
==========

This repository is a [Pretzel](https://github.com/code52/pretzel) site. Pretzel is a .net implementation of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), but in a nutshell, the docs are made up from Markdown files.

Contributions welcome, see [Contributing to TestStack](http://docs.teststack.net/Contributing.html) for more information

To get started with Docs, just clone and run `RunDocs.cmd`, this will fire up a local web server and open the documentation site locally. Any changes you make will trigger a recompile of the documentation, so simply make changes, then refresh your browser to see them.
