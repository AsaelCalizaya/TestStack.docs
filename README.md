==========

This repository is a [Pretzel](https://github.com/code52/pretzel) site. Pretzel is a .net implementation of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), but in a nutshell, the docs are made up from Markdown files.

Contributions welcome, see [Contributing to TestStack](/docs/Contributing.html) for more information
